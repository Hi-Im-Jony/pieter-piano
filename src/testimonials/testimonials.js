      "Pieter was my piano teacher between the years 2006 and 2013, during which time I completed my Grades 6, 7, 8, and Senior Certificate examinations at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. In all of these exams I received a mark of Distinction (over 90%) and also performed well at several music festivals during that same time period; winning medals at the Toccata House and Newpark festivals of music.Pieter also helped me prepare for my Junior and Leaving Certificate music practical exams for which I would end up receiving A grades. The “stats” listed above that Pieter helped me in achieving only tell half the story, however, as Pieter inspired a love for piano in me that persists to this day. At no point in my lessons with Pieter did I ever feel that his only concern was in getting me to do well in exams or competitions. Instead, Pieter encouraged me to play for the love of the instrument itself; to find the joy in daily practice in the service of mastering a beautiful piece of music. Pieter also exposed me to many different genres of music – in my years under his tutelage I played everything from Baroque fugues to Romantic nocturnes, church hymns to musical numbers, as well as various contemporary pieces and everything else in between. He encouraged me to seek out the music that I liked and teach it to myself, and was always more than willing in helping me with trickier passages that I couldn’t manage on my own. This exposure to a wide variety of pieces really bolstered my interest in classical music as a whole. I found that I enjoyed listening to Lyric FM, going to the National Concert Hall, and seeking out performances on YouTube because I had more experience in playing the kind of music performed in those “venues”. It’s a rare thrill to see a piece of music that you are currently working on being performed by an undisputed master of the craft, and I found that doing so would both spur me on to listen to more classical music as well as take more pride in my own playing. Pieter would show me recordings of different artists playing the pieces I was working on and we would both take note of the elements of these varying interpretations as inspiration for my own playing. I really appreciated this impetus by Pieter to figure out for myself what it was that I liked about a specific pianist’s playing style; it aided me immeasurably in improving the quality of my own performances as well as giving me a deeper appreciation for the craft of piano playing as a whole. Pieter provides a unique blend of top-class expertise, holistic appreciation of piano playing and music in general, as well as empathy and patience in his teaching style. I always felt that Pieter treated me as an equal in our lessons and that any feedback he gave me was always delivered in a fair and intelligent manner. His love of music always shone through in our lessons and that enthusiasm was infection; I always felt motivated and ready to get down to practicing after each of his lessons. It is one thing being a technically good piano player, but it is an entirely other thing to be an excellent teacher. Having dabbled in teaching myself in recent years I realise just how difficult it is to engender a love of piano in a student while simultaneously helping that student improve their playing. Pieter is that excellent teacher – I always felt like he cared about me and my playing which served to inspire me further. I would not have the same love for the piano nor the proficiency to play it fairly regularly without Pieter’s superb teaching for those seven years. Piano is something I use now in my adult life as a form of escapism and relaxation, and I sincerely thank Pieter for his role in making that possible for me. Taking lessons with Pieter is a great idea – your playing will improve dramatically in the presence of a teacher who truly knows how to inspire and teach.",
